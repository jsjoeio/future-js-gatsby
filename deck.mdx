When I was thinking about this talk and the main purpose - the thing I wanted you to walk away with - this is what I landed on. *Shows slide*

At the end of this, I want you to think "I could build my next website/blog with Gatsby.js" - so really, it's about awareness. Awareness that this exists, it's exciting and fun and could be the solution for your next project.
