I love to start off my talks by getting to know you all a little bit. I'm going to ask a couple of questions and I'd like you all to participate.

Raise your hand if you've...Okay, keep your hand raised.
Raise your hand if you've.. If you look around, almost everyone has their hand raised. Good! Then this talk should provide you with some type of value.

When I was thinking about this talk and the main purpose - the thing I wanted you to walk away with - this is what I landed on. *Shows slide*

At the end of this, I want you to think "I could build my next website/blog with Gatsby.js" - so really, it's about awareness. Awareness that this exists, it's exciting and fun and could be the solution for your next project.

# Gatsby & Sentry

<Appear>
  <h3>📖👀 Open source</h3>
  <h3>👨‍💼👩‍💼 Backed by investors</h3>
  <h3>💪🌎 Community & contributions</h3>
</Appear>


```notes
When discussing a topic that might be new to some of you, I like to relate it to something you already know.

Since this is happening at Sentry, I thought it would be the perfect for us to see how the two are similar.

The main one: they're both open source. So Gatsby is built in JS and available on GitHub. Sentry, built in Python, also on GitHub.

Backed by investors - the founders of Gatsby created a company (Gatsbyjs.com - automation for websites) and raised 3.8m while Sentry raised Series B funding (16m) around May.

Lastly, they have strong developer communities and encourage contributions.
